          Hello, we are Chris Lynch, Evan Murphy and Erin Slaney. We are
          Software Development students and for our final project in semester
          two we have decided to create an Pet directory app. We decided to do
          this app because when someone is looking to adopt a pet, it would be a
          good idea to have all of the important information about the type of
          pet, the temperament, life expectancy, etc.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default AboutUs;
